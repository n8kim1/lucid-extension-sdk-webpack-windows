/**
 * This function implements the O(n*log(n)) algorithm from the wikipedia article
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_increasing_subsequence to get the longest increasing sub-sequence of the numbers
 * in the array. Note that the algorithm simply ignores undefined entries. This is current used to optimize data usage
 * in the ItemOrderPatch metadata collection.
 *
 * @param X an array of distinct numbers (or undefineds, which are ignored)
 * @returns An array of numeric entries pulled from X which are in the same order as they were in X, and have the
 *             longest possible length of all such possible arrays. This answer may not be unique, but it will be
 *             as long or longer than all other candidates.
