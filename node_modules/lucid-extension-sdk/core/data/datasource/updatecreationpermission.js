/**
 * UpdateCreationPermission is used by data source updates from third party data integrations to indicate
 * how much data that particular request is allowed to create. If the data source update would require creating
 * something at a higher level of permission, the request will fail.
 *
 * The levels are 'DataSource', 'Collection', 'Item', and 'None'. 'DataSource' is the most permissive, allowing the
 * update to create new data sources and anything contained in them (i.e. collections and items). 'Collection' allows
 * the update to create new collections and items only in existing data sources. 'Item' allows the update to modify the contents
 * of existing on-document collections, but not to create the collections or data sources needed to hold them.
 *
 * The original purpose of this parameter was to make it so that in-flight patches to edit on-document data could not
 * accidentally re-create a collection that the user had manually deleted while the patch was in-flight.
